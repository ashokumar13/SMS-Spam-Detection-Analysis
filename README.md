# SMS Spam Detection Analysis - NLP

This project focuses on building a machine learning model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. It demonstrates the practical use of NLP in text classification and email/SMS filtering systems.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Spam messages are a major issue in digital communication, often leading to fraud and information overload. The objective of this project is to detect whether an incoming SMS is spam or not using supervised learning and NLP techniques.

## ✅ Objectives

* Clean and preprocess SMS text data.
* Convert raw text into numerical features using NLP.
* Apply classification algorithms for spam detection.
* Evaluate the performance of different models.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
* **Scikit-learn** (for ML models)
* **NLTK** (for natural language processing)

## 📁 Project Structure

* `SMS Spam Detection Analysis - NLP.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire process, including EDA, text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Techniques & Models Used

* Text Cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stemming, etc.)
* Tokenization and Vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)
* Machine Learning Algorithms:

  * Naive Bayes Classifier
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest (optional)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## 📌 Key Features

* End-to-end NLP pipeline
* Efficient SMS spam classifier
* Real-world application in messaging platforms
* Visualization of data distribution and model performance

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset includes two columns:

* **Label**: Indicates if the message is spam or ham
* **Message**: The actual SMS text

> *Note: The dataset is commonly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.*
